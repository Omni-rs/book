# Introduction

<img src="images/banner.png" alt="Omni Book Banner" style="width:100%;">

Welcome to the **Omni Book !**

Here you will find all the essential information about the **Omni Stack**, a suite of libraries and utilities designed to help you develop chain-abstracted applications on the NEAR blockchain. 

### Main Components

The Omni Stack is composed of three main components:

- [**Omni Box**](./components/omnibox.md): A multichain testing environment for developing NEAR smart contracts. It allows developers to integrate easily with the MPC signer and propagate transactions to multiple chains, including Bitcoin, NEAR and EVM networks like Ethereum.

- [**Omni Testing Utilities**](./components/omni-testing-utilities.md): Essential utilities for testing, designed to enhance development efficiency and reduce boilerplate.

- [**Omni JSON RPC Client**](./components/omni-jsonrpc-client.md): A multichain client for interacting with JSON-RPC APIs, enabling communication with multiple Blockchain networks.


### What's Next?

Head over to our [Installation](./getting-started/installation.md) guide to set up the Omni Stack. Once installed, you can get started by following [Hello Omni](./getting-started/hello-omni.md) for your first example.
